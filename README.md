# Mastermind-Game
As a beginner in coding, I've decided to teach myself Python through small projects, hopefully learning the fundamentals of the language on the way. 
**But why choose Python as my language of choice?**
Well, I've always had in interest in Machine Learning and AI (which primarly uses Python as it focuses on Data Science), and it is in general a widely used language by some of the biggest companies to date. Furthermore, I believe that by understanding the logic behind script languages, I will be able to easily adapt to other programming languages as well.
**My Mastermind-Game project plan**
My aim is to create several "attempts" of the game per week, each time tweaking the game until it properly functions as it should (according to the rules). Afterthat, I would like to delve into Pygame so that I can add graphics (essentially creating a GUI).
